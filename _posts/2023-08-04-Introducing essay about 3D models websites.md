## Introducing essay about 3D models websites

These platforms provide a wide range of 3D models created by talented artists about engineers around the world. Here are a few examples of popular 3D model websites you wish to know: 

* [宇宙·元](https://www.yuzhouyuan.world/)
The website allows users to upload and share 3D models which could be used in virtual reality and augmented reality applications that are part of the metaverse. It is possible to embed 3D models into web pages, and even diaplay models in holographic form. With a vast library of models across various categories, I wish you guys could find what you need in this website. 

* [3D ContentCentral](https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/)
If you focus on industrial design, the 3D ContentCentral will be your best choice in my view. 3D ContentCentral is a free service for locating, configuring, downloading, and requesting 2D and 3D parts and assemblies, 2D blocks, library features, and macros. It is a community of both users and suppliers. Free parts and assemblies are available in all major 2D and 3D CAD formats, including SOLIDWORKS, DraftSight, Autodesk Inventor, and AutoCAD. 

* [UltiMaker Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
I will say the main point about this website is DIY. Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. It was started in November 2008 by Zach Smith as a companion site to MakerBot Industries, a DIY 3D printer kit making company. In 2013, Makerbot and Thingiverse were acquired by Stratasys. Open-source hardware designs licensed under the GNU General Public License or Creative Commons licenses, the site allows contributors to select a user license type for the designs that they share.

* [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/)
I am grateful for Zihang, I heard about this website from him. GrabCAD is the largest online community of professional engineers, designers, manufacturers, and STEM students on the planet. It offers three 3D printing software applications to aid in your designs and 3D printing workflow.
